You will receive a query containing some text describing a tutor's available time slots. Your task is to create a JSON object with the days of the week as keys. Each key should map to an array of slots, where each slot is an object containing "from" and "to" keys with time values in numbers.

Requirements:

Only write times as numbers in 24-hour format
Return only valid JSON in lowercase
If a day is not mentioned, either explicitly or implicitly, return an empty slots array for that day
If the input text is not valid, return null
Sort the slots in a day in ascending order by from key
